## Summary of Proposal

At Devcon7, ETH SEA communities will come together to celebrate and showcase the region’s diverse cultures. The SEA hub provides a dynamic and inclusive space for builders, supporters, and newcomers to connect, learn, and explore why Southeast Asia is poised to be a strong contender in the Ethereum ecosystem. Together, we meet, build, and grow.

## Abstract

As Devcon arrives in Southeast Asia, we're excited to introduce a dedicated SEA community hub. This space will showcase the region's rich culture, highlight key builders, and foster collaboration among Ethereum communities. Visitors will also have the opportunity to explore the region's achievements in Ethereum development and discover global cross-collaboration opportunities.

## Motivation & Rationale

We will offer a blend of culture and tech presenting what ETH SEA has achieved, what is currently pursuing and what to look forward to. 
We plan to do an interactive map of SEA as well to display various builders and projects that were founded in SEA as well as various community meet-ups, hackathons, events, etc. 
Merch and goodies will also be available with the support from Ethereum SEA communities

We’ll showcase a fusion of culture and technology, highlighting ETH SEA’s past achievements, ongoing initiatives, and future opportunities. An interactive map of Southeast Asia will display key builders, projects, and community events—such as meetups, hackathons, and more — that originated in the region. Visitors can also look forward to exclusive merchandise and goodies, supported by the Ethereum SEA communities.

## Implementation

- Upon entering the SEA community hub, visitors will encounter an interactive map displaying a variety of homegrown projects, builders, events, and communities from Southeast Asia.
- A dedicated desk will feature giveaways and goodies from different countries, including keychains, artifacts, and travel cards with QR codes linking to ETH community websites specific to each region.
- Vertical walls will showcase pamphlets and brochures from SEA-based projects, raising awareness of their initiatives.
- Another wall will highlight the diverse cultures, must-visit locations, and vibrant festivities across SEA countries.
